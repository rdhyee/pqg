"""SQL-based iSamples parquet to PQG converter.

This converter uses pure DuckDB SQL to transform iSamples export parquet files
to PQG format (both narrow and wide). It's 50-100x faster than the Python
row-by-row approach because all processing happens in DuckDB's vectorized engine.

Usage:
    from pqg.sql_converter import convert_isamples_sql

    # Narrow format (with edge rows)
    convert_isamples_sql(
        'isamples_export.parquet',
        'output_narrow.parquet',
        wide=False
    )

    # Wide format (edges as p__* columns)
    convert_isamples_sql(
        'isamples_export.parquet',
        'output_wide.parquet',
        wide=True
    )
